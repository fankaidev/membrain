# Privacy Disclaimer

**Web Assistant** is an open-source browser extension that provides easier access to AI models directly within your browser. It is designed to work without collecting any personal data from its users.

## We Do Not Collect Any Information

This extension operates independently of any servers, communicating directly with AI model providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc., using API keys provided by the user.

The extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information, browsing history, API keys, or any chat history generated by the users or AI models.

## How We Use Your Information

As the Extension does not collect any user data, there is no personal information usage. The Extension functions on a real-time basis, processing data solely during the user's interaction with the AI model.


## Data Security

We implement safeguards to ensure that any data processed during your interaction with the AI model remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. However, as no data is collected or stored, the risk of a data breach is minimal.

This project is fully open-source and available on [github](https://github.com/fankaidev/web-assistant).

## Changes to This Privacy Disclaimer

We may update this Privacy Disclaimer occasionally. Any changes will be communicated by posting the updated Privacy Disclaimer on this page. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Disclaimer periodically for any updates.

## User Consent

By using this Extension, you are consenting to this Privacy Disclaimer and agreeing to its terms.
